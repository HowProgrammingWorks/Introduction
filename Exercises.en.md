## Prepare environment

1. We need stable operation system, I propose to use
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org) but you can use any OS you want if you are
ready to solve all problems yourself.
2. To edit sources we need text editor or IDE (Integrated Development
Environment):
  - I use `mc` (midnight commander) but I don't recommend it and saying this
  just because I get a lot of questions from students.
  - Here are options:

3. Linter (also see link above to see options).
4. Version Control System `git` - installed by default in Fedora but you can
take installation instructions here https://git-scm.com/downloads for different
operation systems.
5. Github account: https://github.com/join
6. Latest browser: Chrome, Chromium or Firefox
7. Telegram account with assigned name `@yourName`
