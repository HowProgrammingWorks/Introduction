## Prepare enviromnent

1. We need stable operation system, I propose to use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org)
2. To edit sources we need text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
  - I use `mc` (midnight commander) but I don't recomend it and saying that just
  because I get a lot of questions from students.
  - Here are options: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Tools/blob/master/JavaScript/README.md
3. Linter (also see link above)
4. Version Control System `git` - installed by default in Fedora but you can take
installation instructions here https://git-scm.com/downloads
5. Github account: https://github.com/join
6. Latest browser: Chrome, Chromium or Firefox
